NOTES
=====================================================
P.S: adb commands constantly undergo changes check the latest syntax with "<command> help" or from:
https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb
Arguments in angle brackets '<>' are required
Arguments in square brackets '[]' are options
Since adb and fastboot command options are constantly changing check for equivalent command if anyone doesn't work

PRE-INSTALLATION CHECKLIST FOR CUSTOM ROM INSTALLATION
=====================================================

Custom ROM Installation Process:
> Backup factory ROM and Data from recovery for Nandroid backup
> Flash custom ROM
> If successful, reboot to recovery and Wipe/Factory Rest (Dalvik Cache, Cache and Data)
> Flash Gapps or microGApps and setup phone
> If failure restore backup factory ROM from NANDroid image

Root not required to install custom ROM, bootloader unlock and custom recovery is required as factory recovery will only flash signed images
For older phone you have a seperate boot and recovery partition due to which only recovery is flashed available as an *.img file
On never phones boot and recovery are together so a .img and a xxx-installer.zip is available for TWRP

LG devices will delete TWRP recovery on boot
For Samsung devices which use ODIN a different recovery file is needed
Never Windows have ADB drivers but they are wrong. Proper drivers for ADB have to be downloaded and installed for Windows. This is not required for Linux or Mac.
Sometime no-verify-opt-encrypt may not work if decrypting the entire filesystem and some data may remain encrypted
adb logcat -v long > logcat.txt #If something goes wrong get the log in the cwd
fastboot reboot #to reboot phone to system

=====================================================
CUSTOM ROM INSTALLATION PROCESS
=====================================================

Preparation - Collect information and required files:
> Check build, version from About Phone better take a screenshot. Check whether phone is treble supported and partition type (A or A/B)
> Pull a buildprops file from adb (adb pull /system/build.prop OR fastboot getvar all)
> build.prop value of ro.product.name gives device code name
Preparation - Collect information and required files:
> Check build, version from About Phone better take a screenshot. Check whether phone is treble supported and partition type (A or A/B)
> Pull the build.prop file from adb (adb pull /system/build.prop OR fastboot getvar all)
> build.prop value of ro.product.name gives device code name
> adb shell getprop ro.treble.enabled should return true for Treble support
Alternatively
> getprop ro.boot.slot_suffix # will return _a or _b if A/B partition type exists other wise blank output
> getprop ro.build.ab_update # will retrun true if AB parttion exists otherwise blank output
> Some newer phones have /recovery in /boot for these there is a seperate twrp-installer.zip to be installed in the /boot. These phones should not be flashed twrp.img and the twrp installer needs to be on the phone as it will need to be installed after each time a custom ROM is flashed.
> Check for a recovery. root, unroot, custom ROM and GApps (pico) for your phone if available download all these and also stock ROM as backup
> Check if phone is encrypted in which case a No-verify-opt-encrypt.zip file is also requried to be downloaded as well
> If rooting with Magisk.zip then also get a Magisk-unintaller.zip and a Magisk Manager APK
> When booting from twrp you will see a message "Unmodified system partition" if phone is encrypted and will need your PIN to decrypt or do a data wipe

=====================================================
INSTALLATION: DRIVERS, ADB and FASTBOOT
=====================================================
Drivers (ONLY REQUIRED FOR WINDOWS):
If your devices is already listed doesn't always mean that proper drivers are installed you can still check with "adb devices"
> Download Google drivers and open devmgmt.msc> Click on the first entery (Your computer name) > Menu: Action> Add Legacy Hardware> Select ADB Interface and proceed
> Now connect your phone let Windows install ADB drivers > after connecting phone it should show Android ADB interface
and type "adb devices" if output is: "<hex code> device" # Drivers are installed
> If output is: "<hex code> unauthorised" # Drivers installed and USB Debugging on phone needs to be enabled and permission provided on the phone

=====================================================
Installing Google Drivers when driver installation process fails:
Credits: https://www.thecustomdroid.com/google-android-usb-drivers/
> Remove all existing drivers and restart PC
> Connect device and let iet installation go though normally and check with "adb devices"

Manual installation of drivers:
> Open ‘android_winusb.inf‘ and locate ‘[Google.NTx86]‘ section or the ‘[Google.NTamd64]‘ section based on your version of Windows 32 or 64-bit
The format of inf is as follows:
;[device name]
%SingleAdbInterface% = USB_Install, USB\VID_xxxx&PID_xxxx
%CompositeAdbInterface% = USB_Install, USB\VID_xxxx&PID_xxxx&MI_xx

You have to add your device in the format based on device info in devmgmt.msc
> under the ‘Universal Serial Bus controllers‘ OR ‘Other devices‘ sections in Device Manager you would see a yellow-colored triangle warning icon beside the connected device
> Right-click on the device name and click on ‘Properties‘> ‘Details‘ tab and select ‘Hardware Ids‘ from the dropdown menu your device VID and PID will be listed here
> In case your device also has a REV_xxxx ID, you will need to add two lines for the %SingleAdbInterface% item. One without and another with the REV ID. The line with the REV ID should look like:
USB\VID_xxxx&PID_xxxx&REV_xxxx
> For the %CompositeAdbInterface% item, you will further need to add ‘MI_01‘ ID towards the end. With the MI_01 ID, the line should look like:
USB\VID_xxxx&PID_xxxx&MI_01
P.S: To check if what you are doing in right you can check the information for the google devices in the same file
> replace the ‘[device name]‘ item with your actual device
> Now try to install the drivers as usual from devmgmt.msc and they should go though

=====================================================

Bootloader Unlocking Process: UNLOCKING BOOTLOADER WIPES DATA, BACKUP DATA BEFORE THIS
> Enable developer mode (Click 7 times on build number in settings)
> Enable USB Debugging (Settings)
> Enable "OEM Unlock" in settings (Andoid M onwards has this option)
> Connect device and put it in in file tranfer mode (MTP) #for general compaitibility not necessary in most cases
adb devices #check if your device is showing (should show an ID and say device next to it) it will confirm is drivers are installed. USB debugging must be enabled on the phone and install via USB should be enabled in developer options, connect in file transfer mode  and accept connection on device
adb reboot bootloader #to go into fastboot mode or Vol Up+Pwr button
fastboot devices #should show your device with an ID and say fastboot next to it which means fastboot is working
fastboot flashing unlock #for new version (if previous command doesn't work)) again replace with lock to lock
fastboot oem device-id #should give device ID if drivers are properly installed good command to verify before making system changes
fastboot oem unlock #to unlock bootloader replace with lock for locking bootloader

=====================================================

Recovery Flashing Process:
First boot with recovery without flashing to make sure it works using the following command:
fastboot boot twrp.img #boot image through fastboot which is temporary there is no flashing
fastboot flash recovery <filename>.img #Many devices will replace custom recovery after installation. To prevent this TWRP will patch the stock ROM if you reboot into recovey after flashing TWRP

=====================================================

Rooting Process:
> Copy Magisk.zip, Magisk-unintaller.zip and Magisk Manager APK to the device
> Flash Magisk from recovery if there are errors then flash Magisk uninstaller
> After booting into the device if you don't see Magisk Mager in Apps then intall the APK
> Open Magisk Manager and check version for install verification and also do Safely Net check
